Application Summery


The application “Counter” is java based program that lets you easily show and do anding. but you have to follow the basic rules for subletting ie you have to work your way down the column. you can not jump around the column. The column are ordered from left to right. IP Address, Subnet, and finally Network. From top down in each column it goes 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. the switches correspond to the red/green circle next to them(left to right). By default all if the circle should be red meaning off/ 0 in binary when the switch is toggled to on the circle will turn green and represent binary 1. The number below each column represent there value in base 10 (the most common counting system in the world). Below that there is also color wheels the first one is for background color and the second one is for text color
